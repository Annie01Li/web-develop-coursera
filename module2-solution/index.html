"Fitted closet" are built into the walls of the house so that they take up no apparent space in the room. Closets are often built under stairs, thereby using awkward space that would otherwise go unused.</p>

It is commonly found in the form of a bench, with upholstered armrests, and often fitted with springs and tailored cushions.[1][2] Although a couch is used primarily for seating, it may be used for sleeping.</p>
